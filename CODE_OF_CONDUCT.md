# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for all contributors, maintainers, and community members, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity, and sexual orientation.

Mattin AI is an open-source AI toolbox platform built by and for a diverse community. We believe that diversity and inclusion strengthen our project and make it better.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Being respectful**: Listen actively to others and respect differing opinions and experiences
- **Being constructive**: Provide helpful feedback with the intent to improve, not to criticize
- **Being inclusive**: Actively welcome and support people from marginalized groups
- **Being professional**: Keep discussions focused on technical merit and project goals
- **Being collaborative**: Work together toward common objectives and celebrate collective achievements
- **Assuming good faith**: Interpret actions charitably and ask for clarification before assuming negative intent

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination based on protected characteristics
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Deliberate disruption of discussions or work

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All spaces managed by the Mattin AI project, including the GitHub repository, issue tracker, pull requests, discussions, and documentation
- Project events (virtual or in-person meetings, conferences, workshops)
- Official project communications and social media channels
- Private communications when conducting project business

This Code of Conduct also applies outside project spaces when conduct has a reasonable impact on the project community or maintainers.

## Enforcement

Community members who observe violations are encouraged to report them. Reports will be handled confidentially and fairly.

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by emailing **conduct@mattin-ai.com** or opening a private security advisory on GitHub if the matter is sensitive.

**Include in your report:**
- A description of the incident
- Who was involved and who else witnessed it (if comfortable sharing)
- When and where it occurred
- Any relevant links or context

### Investigation & Response

The Mattin AI maintainers will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. Conduct a fair and impartial investigation
3. Maintain confidentiality of the reporter when requested
4. Take appropriate action, which may include:
   - Private conversations with involved parties
   - Public statements clarifying project values
   - Warnings or removal of contributors from project spaces
   - Escalation to law enforcement if appropriate

### Appeals

If you believe a decision was made in error, you may appeal to the project maintainers within 30 days of the decision.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will consider several factors when responding to violations:

- **Impact**: Does the behavior affect the safety or inclusion of project members?
- **Intent vs. Impact**: Was the behavior intentional or did it result from misunderstanding?
- **Pattern**: Is this a first incident or part of a pattern of behavior?
- **Severity**: Does the behavior constitute harassment, discrimination, or pose safety concerns?

Responses are proportional to the violation and may include:

- **Warning**: A private conversation about the behavior and expectations
- **Temporary Suspension**: Temporary removal from project spaces (1-30 days)
- **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from project spaces and contributions
- **Referral**: Escalation to GitHub trust & safety or law enforcement

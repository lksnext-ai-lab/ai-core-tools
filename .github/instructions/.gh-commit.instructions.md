# Git Commit Instructions

## Commit Signing Requirement

All commits must be signed before being pushed to the repository. This ensures commit authenticity and maintains security standards.

### How to sign commits:

1. **Configure GPG signing globally:**
    ```powershell
    git config --global commit.gpgsign true
    ```

2. **Sign individual commits:**
    ```powershell
    git commit -S -m "Your commit message"
    ```

3. **Verify commit signature:**
    ```powershell
    git log --show-signature -1
    ```

**Note:** Ensure your GPG key is properly configured and associated with your GitHub account before signing commits.

## Pull Before Push

Always pull from the remote and resolve any merge conflicts **before** pushing:

```bash
git pull origin <branch>
# Resolve conflicts if any, then:
git push origin <branch>
```

Never push without pulling first — this avoids rejected pushes and keeps history clean.

## Remote Conventions

- **`origin`** (GitHub) is the **primary remote** — all work happens here
- **`lks`** (GitLab) is an **internal mirror** — only push when explicitly requested
- Always push to `origin` by default

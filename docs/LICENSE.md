Mattin AI (IA-Core-Tools) is available under a **dual licensing model**, offering both an open-source license and a commercial license to accommodate different use cases.

## Dual-License Overview

| | AGPL-3.0 (Open Source) | Commercial License |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | Free | Paid |
| **Commercial use** | Subject to copyleft | Full rights, no copyleft |
| **Source disclosure** | Required for network use | Not required |
| **Modifications** | Must be open-sourced | May remain proprietary |
| **Support** | Community | Professional, with SLA |
| **Warranty** | None | Included |

For the full details, see the authoritative [Licensing Overview](../LICENSING.md) in the repository root.

## Open Source — AGPL-3.0

The default license for this project is the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0**. Its key characteristics are:

- Free to use, modify, and distribute
- Copyleft: modifications and derived works must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0
- Network use counts as distribution — if you run a modified version as a service, you must make your source code available to users of that service
- Community contributions are welcome and encouraged

The full AGPL-3.0 text is in the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file at the repository root.

**Best for:** open-source projects, personal use, educational purposes, and community development.

## Commercial License

For organizations that need to use Mattin AI without copyleft obligations, a commercial license is available from LKS Next. Key benefits include:

- Full commercial use rights without source-disclosure requirements
- Proprietary modifications allowed
- Client project deployment without open-source obligations
- Enterprise-level support and warranty

The complete commercial terms are in [COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md](../COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md). A template agreement for client projects is available in [CLIENT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md](../CLIENT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md).

**Best for:** commercial projects, enterprise deployments, client services, and proprietary integrations.

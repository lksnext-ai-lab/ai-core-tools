* Use the work without restriction.

* Distribute copies of the work within the LKS Next group.

The rights granted under this license may be exercised using any currently known or future media, formats, or carriers, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

The licensor grants the licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use its patents, to the extent necessary to exercise the rights granted to the licensee under this license in relation to the work.

## 3. Provision of Source Code

The licensor may make the work available either in source code or executable code. If the licensor provides it in executable code, the licensor shall also provide a machine-readable copy of the source code for each copy of the work that the licensor distributes, or shall refer to a location in a notice following the copyright notice of the work where the source code can be easily and freely obtained, as long as the licensor distributes or makes the work available.

## 4. Limitations of Copyright

It is not the purpose of this license to limit exceptions or limitations of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner in the work that benefit the licensee. Nor does this license affect the exhaustion of these rights.

## 5. Licensee Obligations

The granting of the rights set out above is subject to several restrictions and obligations on the part of the licensee:

* Inner Source: The licensee may only use the work for the business purposes of the LKS Next group.
* Copyright Notice, License Text, Contributor Acknowledgment: The licensee must retain all copyright, patent, or trademark notices and all notices of the license and disclaimer of warranty unchanged. Each copy of the work that the licensee distributes or makes available must include these notices and this license. The licensee must clearly indicate on each derivative work that the work has been modified and include the date of modification.
* "Copyleft" Clause: The licensee may only distribute copies of the original work or derivative works within the LKS Next group under the terms of this LKSISL or a later version of this license. The licensee (who becomes the licensor) may not offer or impose any additional terms or conditions for the work or the derivative work that alter or restrict the terms of this license.
* Provision of Source Code: If the licensee distributes or makes copies of the work available, the licensee must provide a machine-readable copy of the source code or indicate a location where the source code can be easily and freely obtained, as long as the licensee distributes or makes the work available.
* Trademark Use: This license does not grant permission to use any trademarks, trade names, or service marks of the licensor, except as necessary for an accurate and proper description of the origin of the work and for reproducing the copyright notice.

## 6. Authors and Contributors

The original licensor warrants that they own the copyright in the original work or have obtained a license to it and that they have the right to grant this license.

Each contributor warrants that they own the copyright in the changes they make to the work and have the right to create a contribution under this license and to submit it.

For each case in which the license is accepted, the original licensor and all subsequent contributors grant a license to use their contributions to the work under the terms of this license.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranty

If the internal performance conditions do not apply, the following provisions shall apply.

Work on this work is continuously ongoing; it is being improved by countless contributors. The work is not complete and may contain errors (commonly known as "bugs") that are inherent in this type of development.

For these reasons, the work is provided under this license "as is" without any warranty. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, and the absence of other intellectual property rights violations (see Article 6 of this license for more details).

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the license and a condition for granting rights to the work.

## 8. Limitation of Liability/Liability Cap

If the internal performance conditions do not apply, the following provisions shall apply.

Except in cases of intent or causing personal injury, the licensor shall not be liable for any direct or indirect, material or immaterial damages of any kind resulting from the license or the use of the work; this includes, but is not limited to, loss of business value, production downtime, computer failure or error, data loss, and economic damage, even if the licensor has been informed of the possibility of such damages. However, the licensor remains liable under applicable product liability laws to the extent that such laws apply to the work.

## 9. Additional Agreements

If the licensee distributes the work, they may enter into additional agreements that include obligations or services that are consistent with this license.

The licensee may only enter into obligations in their own name and not on behalf of the original licensor or any other contributor, and only if they undertake to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless all contributors against any claims or liabilities that may arise from their assumption of warranty or liability.

## 10. Acceptance of the License

You accept the terms of this license by clicking the "Accept License" button below the license text or by otherwise indicating your acceptance in a similar manner. Clicking the button constitutes a clear and unequivocal acceptance of this license and its terms and conditions.

Similarly, exercising any of the rights granted in Article 2 of this license, such as creating a derivative work or distributing or making the work or its copies available, constitutes clear and unequivocal acceptance of this license and its terms and conditions.

## 11. Information Obligations

If the licensee distributes or makes the work available (e.g., by offering it for download from a website), the licensee must provide the recipient or the public with minimum information via the distribution channel or medium used, typically regarding the licensor, the license, and its availability, the conclusion of the license agreement, and how the license can be stored and reproduced by the licensee.

## 12. Termination of the License

The license and the rights granted under it shall automatically terminate if the licensee breaches any of the terms of this license.

Termination of the license does not terminate the licenses of third parties to whom the licensee has made the work available under this license, as long as those parties comply with the terms of the license.

## 13. Submission of Contributions

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, any contribution that the licensor accepts for inclusion in the work shall be subject to the terms of this license, without any additional terms applying. Regardless of the above, no provision of this license shall replace or modify the terms of any separate license agreement that the licensor and contributor may have entered into regarding such contributions.

For jurisdictions where moral rights in a work may arise, the copyright owner/author waives their moral rights to the extent necessary to effectively implement the license of the above-mentioned usage rights.

## 14. Miscellaneous

Subject to Article 9, this license constitutes the complete agreement between the parties regarding the work.

German law applies. If any provision of this license is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the license as a whole. Such provisions shall be construed or amended to the extent necessary to make them valid and enforceable.

## 15. Corporate Changes

In the event of corporate changes, such as the sale or spin-off of an LKS S. Coop. entity, the following rule applies:

Further use of the licensed software by a company no longer part of the LKS Next group is subject to the approval of the authors or the LKS S. Coop. Technology Business Commitee.

## 16. License Changes

The authors of a work may jointly decide to change the license, e.g., to publish the work as open-source software. If the authors are not available or cannot agree, the LKS S. Coop. Technology Business Commitee may decide on behalf of all authors within LKS S. Coop. to change the license for a work.

## 17. Dispute Resolution

In addition to the provisions of the internal performance conditions between the parties, the following applies between the parties:

In the event of disputes concerning the interpretation or application of this license involving more than one LKS S. Coop. entity, the LKS S. Coop. Technology Business Commitee shall serve as the dispute resolution body, which may be invoked by either party.
